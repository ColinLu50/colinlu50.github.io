 I'm currently pursuing my Ph.D. degree of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, supervised by Prof. Cunsheng Ding from HKUST and Prof. Qi Wang from SUSTech. 
I had a deep collaboration with Prof. Shengcai Liu and Prof. Ke Tang for [NICAL lab](http://www.nical.ai/). 
My General research interest lie in Combinatorial Optimization, Adversarial Attack & Defense, AI Security.
