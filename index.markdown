I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in CSE at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, supervised by Prof. [Cunsheng Ding](https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/about/people/faculty/cunsheng-ding) from HKUST, co-supervised by Prof. [Qi Wang](https://dake98.github.io/) from SUSTech. 
I had a deep collaboration with Prof. Shengcai Liu and Prof. Ke Tang for [NICAL lab](http://www.nical.ai/). 
My General research interest lie in Trustworthy AI, Reliability & Security of LLM.
